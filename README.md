Conversational AI Model
This project showcases my work on building a sophisticated Conversational AI model as part of my Artificial Intelligence assignment. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow and the tflearn library, I employed Natural Language Processing and Neural Network concepts to construct an AI contextual chatbot.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running the following commands:

1. pip3 install nltk
2. pip3 install tensorflow==1.13.2
3. pip3 install numpy
4. pip3 install tflearn
5. pip3 install random
6. pip3 install json
Use Cases
The integration of AI and automation is pivotal in today's technological landscape, and chatbots exemplify this fusion. Here are some compelling use cases for leveraging chatbots across industries:

Efficiency and Labor Savings:
Chatbots automate routine tasks, saving time and reducing the workload on human employees.

24x7 Support:
Chatbots provide continuous support, addressing user queries and issues at any time of the day.

Instant Service:
Users experience immediate responses, enhancing the overall customer service experience.

Scalability:
Chatbots can interact with numerous users simultaneously, making them suitable for handling large volumes of inquiries.

Enhanced Communication:
Chatbots facilitate seamless communication, fostering a more interactive and user-friendly experience.

How to Run?
To run the application, utilize Jupyter Notebook. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell. After running all cells, call the response() method with your queries. For example:


response("What are the key services offered by your company?")

This chatbot is tailored for a Cybersecurity-focused industry. It serves as a customer care chatbot, providing insights into the services offered by the cybersecurity sector. Additionally, users can inquire about fundamental concepts in cybersecurity, such as cryptography and hashing.

By integrating this chatbot into a website using technologies like Flask, you can customize the intent file to suit your requirements, enhancing your website's performance. Automation, especially through chatbots, is becoming increasingly prevalent, and this project reflects the growing importance of AI in automating customer services.

Feel free to experiment, tweak, and expand on this chatbot to align with your specific industry or application needs.
